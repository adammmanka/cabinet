# progress

## Learnings
- Ralph agent can silently return **empty payloads** via `openclaw agent --agent ralph --json` even when status=ok; don’t assume messaging works—validate payloads.
- The OpenClaw gateway log can show full run metadata even when payloads are empty; use `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` for diagnosis.

## Iteration 1 — Add initial placeholder task
- What was done
  - Marked the first PRD task complete.
  - NOTE: In a prior run, the agent incorrectly auto-created PRD/progress when missing. Don’t do that; fail fast instead.
- Files affected
  - PRD.md
  - progress.txt
- Learnings for next cycles:
  - Patterns
    - Keep the PRD/progress files present in the workspace root; the agent loop depends on them.
  - Traps
    - If PRD.md/progress.txt are missing, the cycle can’t start (no task discovery).
  - Helpful context
    - This iteration was a bootstrap to confirm commit/push flow.
