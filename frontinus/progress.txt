# progress

## Learnings
- Ralph agent can silently return **empty payloads** via `openclaw agent --agent ralph --json` even when status=ok; don’t assume messaging works—validate payloads.
- The OpenClaw gateway log can show full run metadata even when payloads are empty; use `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` for diagnosis.

## Iteration 2 — Prevent bootstrap files from being auto-created by the agent
- What was done
  - Investigated where auto-creation could happen; determined it’s a process/config issue (agent ran in wrong workspace), not repo code.
  - Captured evidence that `openclaw agent --agent ralph --json` can return status=ok with **empty payloads**; documented in Learnings.
- Files affected
  - PRD.md
  - progress.txt
- Learnings for next cycles:
  - Patterns
    - Treat missing PRD/progress as a hard failure condition; don’t generate them.
    - Validate agent runs by checking payloads, not just status.
  - Traps
    - If an agent is pointed at the wrong workspace, it will appear “blocked” and you may be tempted to bootstrap files—don’t.
  - Helpful context
    - `openclaw status --all --json` and `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` include `workspaceDir` and full run metadata.

## Iteration 1 — Add initial placeholder task
- What was done
  - Marked the first PRD task complete.
  - NOTE: In a prior run, the agent incorrectly auto-created PRD/progress when missing. Don’t do that; fail fast instead.
- Files affected
  - PRD.md
  - progress.txt
- Learnings for next cycles:
  - Patterns
    - Keep the PRD/progress files present in the workspace root; the agent loop depends on them.
  - Traps
    - If PRD.md/progress.txt are missing, the cycle can’t start (no task discovery).
  - Helpful context
    - This iteration was a bootstrap to confirm commit/push flow.
